            In the ESUMS cafeteria you are required to take a fruit or vegetables. Many of the fruits and vegetables go to waste since most kids don't take them of their own accord. In "The Food Fix" the player makes sure that food does not go to waste. This shows how making the right choices leads to only good outcomes.
